Simon Amstell's Do Nothing remains a favourite of the last decade yet with his subsequent US tours, appearances on The View and Letterman, he feels more Brit-in-America now than an exhibit of what's going on in British comedy. In watching an interview with Frankie Boyle and Jimmy Carr, it was interesting to see them answer \"so what comedians are you both into?\" with an almost immediate \"Doug Stanhope\" followed by a list of other US comics. I wonder how many US comedians would name Brits in the same scenario? I wonder why it is that when we stand around outside venues talking about who we're interested in, almost without exception, acts lean towards either the American mainstream (Louis CK, Bill Burr) or the British acts that appear to shirk ours (Stewart Lee, Daniel Kitson).",

That night was run by Frank Cassidy and Alfie Noakes under the moniker: Dead Comedian’s Socks. I think the night itself was called “Touching Cloth — New Material”. The idea being: if you say something new, it tanks and stinks-out the room — you touch the cloth/banner behind you and everyone has to shout “New Material!” to get the energy back. A novel antidote to the room-stink of a not-worked-out new idea.",

It also seems odd that the source of the inspiration was left so vague, in light of the speculations of joke theft.
